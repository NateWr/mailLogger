# Mail Logger

A plugin for OJS 3.2+ that will log every email sent by the system. This is a development tool and **should not be used on a live site**.

The emails will be logged to the `files_dir` directory specified in your OJS config file. You will find each email at `/<files_dir>/maillog/<Ymdhis>-<microtime>`.
